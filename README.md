# Description
Created with React, this employee directory is a fast and easy way to display non-confidential information about employees for managers or co-workers. Employees can be searched for by name so team members can be found more easily. 

# How It Works
When a user loads the page, a table of employees is rendered. 
By typing a name in the search bar, the employees in the directory are filtered through and the searched employee is displayed if the name is found in the directory.
