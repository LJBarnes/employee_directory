# Description
Created with React, this employee directory is a fast and easy way to display non-confidential information about employees for managers or co-workers. Employees can be searched for by name and the directory can be sorted by alphabetical order so team members can be found more easily. 

# How It Works
When a user loads the page, a table of employees is rendered. 
By typing a name in the search bar, the employees in the directory are filtered through and the searched employee is displayed if the name is found in the directory. By pushing the sort button, the names will be put in order alphabetically.
